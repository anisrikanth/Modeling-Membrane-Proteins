# Modeling-Membrane-Proteins

This projects shows a comparison of different sequence and structure-based methods that are used for predicting the transmembrane regions of various proteins, as well as analyze the preference for different amino acids within the membrane region. In particular, sequence-based predictions from the TOPCONS server are used, alongside some information from the PDBTM database which indicate different membrane regions.
